    <p>PV power penetration is increasing rapidly. Hence, its impact on the grid operation becomes a major concern for the utilities. Predictive models of renewable energy are an essential requirement  to  analyze  this  impact.  Design  of  an  accurate,  effective  and  powerful  model  for forecasting is a highly challenging task in weather dependent renewable energy sources. This paper  proposes  a  novel  modular  Least  Square  SVM  (LS-SVM)  based  Regression  model  for solar-power  forecast.  The  solar  power  is  calculated  using  predicted  value  of  solar  irradiance. This method highly reduces the computation complexity and time. The proposed model uses a Time-Series  decoupling  strategy  where  instead  oftreating the historical  data  as  a  single  time series, the data is split into multiple time series. Each time series carries the historical data of solar irradiance at a particular time of the day during the period under consideration. The model has shown promising results with a MAPE of 3.5% for a day ahead prediction</p>

    <p> Stand-alone PV systems are increasingly becoming popular as a viable alternative to utility power supply, especially in remote corners, where accessibility is a problem to deploy conventional distribution systems. It is also becoming a choice of conscious consumers who wish to contribute to environment protection through use of green energy. In this context, it is vital to have a fault diagnosis system in place to identify various faults in the PV system. This paper presents a signature analysis of various electrical faults in a stand-alone PV system, with battery storage. The focus of the work is to minimize the sensors to be deployed for detection and classification of the faults.

    <p>Given the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide, and the ambitious targets set for the near future, the smart charging of an EV fleet must be seen as a priority. Specifically, we study a scenario where EV charging is managed through self-interested EV aggregators (<i>e.g.</i> car parks or electricity suppliers) who compete in the day-ahead market in order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clientsâ€™ requirements. In order to reduce electricity costs and lower the impact on electricity markets, we study the possibility of inter-aggregator cooperation. Specifically, we model the system as a coalitional game and prove that the resulting game is superadditive and balanced, hence having a non-empty core. However, due to the game not being convex, the Shapley value is not guaranteed to lie in the core. As an alternative, we propose employing the payment mechanism provided by the least-core, which we show to be in the core in our setting. Furthermore, a realistic empirical evaluation is presented, using real market and driver data from the Iberian Peninsula. The simulations show that large payment reductions can be achieved when using the coordination mechanism. Moreover, we show that the individual payments of the least-core are very close to the Shapley value, suggesting that the payment mechanism is both fair and stable.</p>
